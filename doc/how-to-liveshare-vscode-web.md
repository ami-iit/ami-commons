- At this point, you can either open a folder, but also create directly a new file, without opening any folder. When other people join, the file might not be visible to them. In this case, as a workaround, you can create a new file in a new VSCode tab, and then switch back to the original file tab. This switch between VSCode tabs seems to trigger the update to the other connected users, that in turn can start editing the file.

## Join
- Open the link in the browser. You can select to keep working on the browser
